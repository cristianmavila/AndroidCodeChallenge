# Requirements

The goal of this exercise is to let you show your programming skills in Android. But don’t worry, the requirements are quite simple!
You need to implement an app that:

- Has two screens:
    One of them should be a ​list of posts​. You should show ​at least​ the title for each of them. There is no predefined UI for the list, so here is your chance to impress us!
    The other screen should be ​the post's details​. This screen should have ​at least​ the post title, the post body and the author's name.

- You can fetch the posts and authors using the following endpoints:
    http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
    http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

- Kotlin is not required, but preferable

- Compiles and runs from Android Studio
